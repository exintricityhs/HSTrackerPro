- Copy the included file config/log.config to the following directory:

- ~/Library/Preferences/Blizzard/Hearthstone/log.config

- Note: ~refers to your /Users/<username> folder. By default, this folder is hidden. You can enable visibility of the folder following these instructions: [Enable Visibility](http://www.macworld.com/article/2057221/how-to-view-the-library-folder-in-mavericks.html "Enable Visibility")


# CREATE DECKS
- Decks can be created from the website http://hearthstats.net or by hand.

- It is recommended that you create the decks at hearthstats.net to avoid typos.

a text file.
- See the examples in the /decks folder

# USAGE

    - Cards from your deck into your hand.
    - Cards played by your opponent.
